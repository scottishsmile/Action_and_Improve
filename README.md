# Action and Improvement Register
A Django web app.

Keep a list of actions and improvements for your workplace!

An improvement is an idea, or a change in process. A logical component. 
Add an idea to the improvement register and a supervisor will review it. 
If it's a change in process they assign it to themselves and keep the improvemnt item on the notice board updated with their progress.
If this idea or process is approved, it can then be converted to an action and implimented.

An action is something to be done physically. An implimentation of an idea.
Raise an action on the notice board and assign it to who will do the work.
Give an expected completion date and keep the record updated.


Example:
--------
Dave (worker) thinks cleanliness is next to godliness.
Dave raises an improvement idea "Clean the workplace at the start of every day".
Dave assigns the improvement to Bob (Supervisor).
Bob discusses the idea with the team, who agree, and makes it part of their work process.
Bob raises an action to "Collect cleaning sprays and wipes from the warehouse" and assigns it to Tom (another worker)
Bob raises another action to "Make a sanitation station" in the office. A table with all the cleaning materials on it for easy access. He assigns the action to Dave.
